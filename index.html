            <h2>The story</h2>
                <p class="bladsalaad">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
                That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
                They said, <q class="neighbours">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.
                This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></p>
                <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and
                said,
                <q class="neighbours">Oh, isn’t that lucky.
                 What a great turn of events.
                You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,<q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></p>

                <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
                The neighbors then said, <q class="neighbours">Oh dear, that’s too <q class="bad">bad</q>,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></p>
                 <p>
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son
                 because he had a broken leg.
                Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="neighbours">Isn’t that great!></q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></p>
                 <p>
                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
                     whether anything that happens in it is <q class="good">good</q> or <q class="bad">bad</q> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the
                misfortune;
                or, you never know what will be the consequences of <q class="good">good</q> fortune.<q>Maybe.</q></p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p><em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are <em class="good">good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <em class="good">good</em> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
